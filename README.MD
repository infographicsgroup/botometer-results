# BOTOMETER SCRAPING RESULTS

This repo contains two folders:

`code` contains the (uncommented, sorry) source code and a link to the original framework. You probably will not be able to run the code, since it is part of a bigger framework. But for reasons of transparency and confirmability and allowing to verify our approach, we want to publish the code

`data` contains the results of Botometer, including the raw data.
You can also reproduce the Botometer scores manually via https://botometer.iuni.iu.edu/, but we advise caution because:

1. The Botometer is requesting to get WRITE access to your Twitter account. For security reasons we recommend to only use a noncritical Twitter account and not e.g. your company account. Also we recommend to revoke the access rights for Botometer to your Twitter account after usage via https://twitter.com/settings/sessions
2. The Botometer algorithm gets updated. It is possible, that results will be totally different after the next update.
3. Twitter users do not have a consistent behaviour. It my change in time. That will also change the Botometer results in time.
